        <p><strong>What does ADA website compliance mean?</strong></p>
        <p>ADA compliance means that local governments are required, and expected, to ensure all their digital content is accessible by citizens with visual, auditory, and other physical limitations and disabilities. As an organization that serves citizens, it's essential to offer an accessible website, and one that provides equitable access to news, information, and local resources.</p>
        <p><em>For websites to be ADA compliant, they need to be accessible.</em></p>

        <h2>ADA Compliance Checklist for Websites </h2>
        <p>The first step to ensuring compliance is to evaluate your website using the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).</p>
        <p>The criteria are categorized according to three levels, providing successively greater degrees of accessibility:</p>
        <p>1.<strong> Level A (minimum) </strong>- The most basic web accessibility features. Sets a minimum level of accessibility, but does not generally achieve broad accessibility for many situations.</p>
        <p>2.<strong> Level AA (mid-range)</strong> - Deals with the biggest and most common barriers for disabled users.</p>
        <p>3.<strong> Level AAA (highest)</strong> - The highest level of web accessibility. It is often not possible to satisfy all Level AAA success criteria for some content types.</p>

          <li><span >Title all pages so that they relate to the page's content </span></li>
          <li><span>Use citizen-facing wording rather than internal terminology</span></li>

        <ol start="2">
          <li id="2" ><strong><span >Text and Font</span></strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p><span>Color alone can't be used to differentiate information. Instead use:</span></p>
        <ul >
          <li><span >Bold and italic text</span></li>
          <li>Use bulleted lists</li>
          <li>Feature areas or modules in your CMS</li>
          <li>Have a high-contrast color scheme</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Avoid dense paragraphs of text</p>
        <ol start="3">
          <li id="3" ><strong><span>Tables</span></strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Since <span>tables are for data and not page layouts, be sure to populate tables with a column header and cell information.</span></p>
        <ol start="4">
          <li id="4"><strong><span>Visuals</span></strong></li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
          <li><span>Always include alternative (alt) text</span></li>
          <li><span>Pay attention to the descriptive details such as the non-image visual</span></li>
          <li><span>All visuals need alt text, not just photos, so be sure to add alt text with icons, buttons, banners, logos, sketches, etc.&nbsp;</span></li>
          <li><span>Any visual element that conveys a message should have alt text</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p><span>If there is no text to identify the image, a blind person's screen reader could not identify the image. The user would not have any way of knowing if the image is a logo, link to another page or simply a stock photo.</span></p>
        <p><span>Provide text alternatives for any non-text content so that it can be changed into other forms that people need. Examples of other forms include large print, braille, speech, symbols, or simpler language.</span></p>

          <li>Color cannot be the only means to convey information.</li>
          <li>Color contrast ratio: All text must have a color contrast ratio of 4.5:1 against its background.</li>

          <li id="8"><span><strong>Enhance Your Multi-Media</strong></span></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Make images and video more accessible by adding audio descriptions to images, including the narration of changes in setting, gesturing, and other details. In addition, add text captions for the deaf.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Let's break it down further into Level A and Level AA compliance to determine if your website currently meets the accessibility requirements.</p>
        
        <h2>Level AA - ADA Compliance Checklist</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Live video or audio content includes captions</li>
          <li>Contrast ratio between text and page backgrounds is at least 4.5-to-1</li>
          <li>Text on pages can be resized to 200% while still maintaining form&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Images are not used where text can achieve the same purpose&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Pages on the site can be accessed in multiple ways</li>
          <li>Keyboard focus is visible and clear</li>
          <li>The language of content is identified in code with any language changes</li>
          <li>Menus and buttons are used consistently regardless of the user’s location in the site&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Users are given suggestions on how to solve input errors</li>
          <li>An error prevention technique is used whenever the user is entering sensitive data</li>
          <li>Underlined text that does not provide a link is removed</li>
          <li>Redundant links on the same page are eliminated or minimized&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
